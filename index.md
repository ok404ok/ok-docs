# OK Whitepaper (Lite)  
Version 0.1

---

## 1. Introduction

OK is a community-first digital experiment built around a simple idea:

**Meaning is created by participation.**

OK does not promise innovation through complexity.  
It explores how shared attention, coordination, and ownership can transform something minimal into something valuable.

This document outlines the current structure, intent, and direction of OK.

---

## 2. What is OK?

OK is a social-native token designed to grow alongside its community.

- No hype-driven roadmap
- No artificial urgency
- No hidden mechanics

Every OK exists because someone chose to participate.

---

## 3. Core Principle

> Supply grows with the community.

The OK supply is directly tied to the number of followers.

- Each follower represents **100 OK**
- This mechanism aligns growth with real interest
- Empty growth = no advantage

The community itself defines the scale.

---

## 4. Token Overview

- **Name:** OK  
- **Symbol:** OK  
- **Network:** Solana  
- **Maximum Supply:** 104,104,104 OK  
- **Initial Minted Supply:** 22,000 OK  
- **Decimals:** 6  

Minting is controlled and intentional.  
There is no automated inflation.

---

## 5. Distribution Philosophy

OK is not distributed through mass airdrops or aggressive farming.

Instead:

- Early participation is recognized
- Contribution matters more than speed
- Community actions shape future distribution

Details are revealed progressively, not all at once.

---

## 6. Governance & Control

- No freeze authority
- No hidden transfer restrictions
- Metadata locked for transparency

Trust is established through simplicity, not promises.

---

## 7. Why OK Exists

OK exists to answer one question:

**What happens when people decide to build meaning together around something simple?**

There is no predefined outcome.
There is no guaranteed value.

Only coordination.

---

## 8. Current Status

- Community forming organically
- Token infrastructure live
- Documentation public
- No liquidity pools yet
- No public sale yet

OK is still early — by design.

---

## 9. Disclaimer

OK is an experimental social token.

It is not an investment product.  
There are no guarantees of value.  
Participation is voluntary and transparent.

Only engage if you understand the nature of experimental community-driven projects.

---

## 10. Closing

OK is not trying to be everything.

It is simply asking:

**Are you OK being part of something before it has a name?**
