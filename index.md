# OK Whitepaper (Lite)  
Version 0.2

---

## 1. Introduction

OK is a community-first digital experiment built around a simple idea:

**Meaning is created by participation.**

OK does not promise innovation through complexity.  
It explores how shared attention, coordination, and ownership can transform something minimal into something valuable.

This document outlines the current structure, intent, and direction of OK.

---

## 2. What is OK?

OK is a social-native token designed to grow alongside its community.

- No hype-driven roadmap  
- No artificial urgency  
- No hidden mechanics  

Every OK exists because someone chose to participate.

---

## 3. Core Principle

> Supply grows with the community.

The OK supply is directly tied to the number of followers.

- Each follower represents **100 OK**
- Growth reflects real attention, not artificial metrics
- Empty growth provides no advantage

The community itself defines the scale.

## 5. Distribution Philosophy

OK is not distributed through mass airdrops or aggressive farming.

Instead:

- Early participation is recognized
- Contribution matters more than speed
- Community actions shape future distribution

Details are revealed progressively, not all at once.

---

## 6. Governance & Control

- No freeze authority  
- No hidden transfer restrictions  
- Metadata locked for transparency  

Trust is established through simplicity, not promises.

---

## 7. Why OK Exists

OK exists to explore one question:

**What happens when people collectively assign meaning to something simple?**

There is no predefined outcome.  
There is no guaranteed value.

Only coordination.

## 11. Closing

OK is not trying to be everything.

It is simply asking:

**Are you OK being part of something before it fully exists?**
